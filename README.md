# WoW 3.3.5 DBML

This repository is a community effort to represent the entire data structure of World of Warcraft 3.3.5 build 12340.  
This includes all Database Client files (short: DBC) and all serverside tables of [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/3.3.5).  

## Work in Progress
- Relationships inside DBC files (Mostly done)
- Relationships of all TC tables
- Relationships between DBC files and TC tables
- Enum definitions of DBC files and TC tables
- Table groups to sort all definitions by functionality (e.g. "Spells")
